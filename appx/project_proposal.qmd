**Team Name :** Tiktok Police **Team Members :** Isa Chen, Shurui Zhang, Raouda Mamane Bello Boubacar Kinassa **Category :** Entertainment

## Short Description of the Project

We are studying how people engage with Tiktok videos, focusing on both informational (“news-like”) and entertainment content.
We will analyze Tiktok video metadata and engagement metrics to determine which factors (hashtags, video length, creator, followers or music) influence video popularity.
Our project aims to explore how trends differ between news content and entertainment content, helping us understand how social media spreads information.

## Research Questions

Which factors (hashtags, music, video length or followers) most strongly predict the popularity of TikTok videos?
How does engagement differ between informational/news videos and entertainment videos on TikTok?
What patterns in TikTok video trends can help explain how people consume news on social media platforms?

## Reasons and Inspiration

TikTok is one of the most influential social media for both entertainment and information sharing.
While it is known for short viral content, an increasing number of users are also using TikTok for news and current events.
We are interested in this topic because people of different ages use TikTok in different ways.
While younger users often watch and share entertainment content, more people are also starting to get news from TikTok.
By comparing how different age groups engage with news and entertainment videos, we hope to understand how TikTok influences the way people from each generation learn and share information.
