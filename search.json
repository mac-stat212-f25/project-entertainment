    "text": "Motivation\nTikTok is one of the most influential platforms for both entertainment and information sharing. While people usually think of TikTok as a place for quick, viral videos, more users today also rely on it to learn about news and current events. This shift made us curious about how different groups of people use TikTok in different ways. Younger users may focus more on fun, creative content, while others are increasingly turning to the platform to stay informed.\nBecause of this, we wanted to explore how engagement differs across entertainment and informational videos, and what patterns might show how people consume content on TikTok. Understanding this matters because TikTok has become a major space where people learn, share, and respond to information. By studying these differences, we hope to better understand the platform’s impact on how each generation interacts with media and forms their view of the world.",

We first examine which factors—such as hashtags, music choice, video length, or follower count—most strongly predict a video’s popularity. We also compare engagement patterns between informational or news-related videos and entertainment-focused content to see how audiences interact with each type. By analyzing these trends, we hope to uncover broader patterns in how people consume information on TikTok and how the platform shapes the way users engage with news on social media.",

    "section": "Background",
    "text": "Background\nPrevious research on social media platforms suggests that engagement is not driven by a single factor, but rather by a combination of content characteristics, creator behavior, and audience dynamics. On TikTok specifically, the “For You Page” algorithm plays a central role in determining visibility, often amplifying content from smaller creators and allowing videos to reach large audiences regardless of follower count. Prior studies and journalistic reporting have highlighted the importance of timing, consistency, and content niche in gaining traction on the platform. Additionally, TikTok differs from other social media platforms in how quickly content can go viral and how engagement is distributed. Unlike platforms where popularity is closely tied to follower count, TikTok allows newer or less established creators to achieve high engagement. This makes it especially interesting to study which features are associated with success and whether informational content performs differently than entertainment content.",

    "text": "Data\nTikTok data collection article TikTok API Top TikTokers\nFor the collection of the top TikTokers, we use the simple webscraping module on Python BeautifulSoup. For the webscraping, we found information for the first 6 columns of our dataset from InflueceGrid. The remaining information was manually entered, citing sources such as Famous Birthdays and TikTok. This dataset top-250-tiktokers.csv looks into the demographics of the top 250 TikTokers and is used to explore possible commonalities of the top influencers on the platform.\nThe sample from 1000 tiktok users profile dataset scrapped from brightdata.com, extract detailed public profile information, including account names, follower counts, and engagement metrics. Popular use cases include sentiment analysis, brand monitoring, and influencer marketing.\n\nData Collection\nData were collected using a combination of automated web scraping and manual data entry. Web scraping was conducted using Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup to extract publicly available information from TikTok-related websites. Manual data entry was used when information was not easily accessible through scraping, particularly for demographic details of top creators.\n\n\nData Acquisition\nAll data used in this project come from publicly available sources. No private or restricted user information was collected. Data were cleaned and organized to ensure consistency across variables, such as standardizing engagement metrics and categorizing content types.\n\n\nData Understanding\nOur datasets include both creator-level variables (such as follower count, verification status, and demographics) and engagement metrics (likes, engagement rate, posting frequency). Because engagement variables are often highly skewed, many of our visualizations use log scales to better represent the distribution and highlight underlying patterns.",

    "text": "Data Insights\nIsa: Tiktok has golden posting hours, engagement rates are much higher in the evening, especially between 5 PM and 10 PM. Weekends—especially Friday and Saturday nights—stand out even more. Engagement varies across languages: Videos in Spanish, Italian, Russian, and Portuguese tend to show higher engagement distributions compared to English. Smaller creators have much higher engagement rates Content topics perform very differently. Lifestyle/Personal videos have the highest engagement rate.\nSabrina： There are certain keywords that are put in bio description on TikTok user profiles that can help boost engagement rate. For example, “instagram” or “cat”. Average engagement across genres for top tiktokers videos, videos for Content House( A shared living space where social media influencers live together to collaborate on creating videos on TikTok, leveraging each other’s audiences to gain followers and views, often in luxurious mansions with great lighting and backdrops.), Art and Media has the most engagement. Famous or not before TikTok’s existence does not affect the audience engagement on TikTok. Famous before TikTok is not a deciding factor on whether will be viral on TikTok. Everyone has equal chance of reaching top engagement. Age is a deciding factor of engagement rate. There is downward trend of engagement rate along with the increase of age. Around the age 20-30 has the highest engagement. Gender in general does not act as a potential factor to engagement.\nRaouda : Our analysis shows a clear positive relationship between posting frequency and total likes. Creators who post more frequently tend to accumulate more total likes over time. While some creators achieve high popularity with relatively few videos, the overall trend suggests that consistency plays a major role in long-term success on TikTok. This supports the idea that virality is often built through sustained posting rather than relying on a single viral video. We also examined engagement rates by verification status and found that non-verified creators often have higher engagement rates than verified creators. Although verified accounts tend to have larger audiences, their engagement rates are more concentrated and generally lower. This suggests that smaller or non-verified creators may have more active or niche audiences that interact more with content.\nAdditionally, engagement varies across regions. Our analysis of engagement distribution by continent shows that creators based in North America and Europe tend to have higher engagement levels on average, though there is significant variation within each region. This highlights how geographic context and audience size may influence engagement.",

    "text": "Conclusion/Big Picture\nOverall, our findings suggest that TikTok engagement is shaped by a combination of consistency, timing, content type, and audience connection rather than traditional measures of popularity like prior fame or verification status. Smaller creators often outperform larger ones in engagement rate, and lifestyle or personal content tends to resonate most with audiences. TikTok’s algorithm appears to reward regular posting and authentic interaction, allowing a wide range of creators to succeed. These results highlight TikTok’s unique role as both an entertainment platform and an information-sharing space. As more users turn to TikTok for news and learning, understanding these engagement patterns becomes increasingly important for studying how media consumption is evolving.",
